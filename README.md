# 🔭 Current Endeavour
Currently, I'm diving deeper into the world of artificial intelligence, LLMs (Large Language Models), and security, seeking ways to blend these technologies with human-computer interaction to create impactful solutions.


# 🌱 My Life
My life journey always goes out of plan, but I'm surviving it!!! 🚴‍♂️💪
Curious about what's the next thing gonna hit me 🧐🔮
Unexpected difficulties are opportunities for me to improve, be receptive, and be optimistic! 💡🌱😊
- **Fun fact:** When I'm not coding 💻 or buried in textbooks 📖, you'll find me lost in the world of books 📚 and cooking 🍳.
