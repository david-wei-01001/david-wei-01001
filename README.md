I'm currently an undergraduate student at the ***University of Toronto***, pursuing a Computer Science Specialist degree.\
My journey in tech has led me through fascinating roles, from ensuring game quality at ***Uken Games Inc.*** to innovating at the ***MEDCVR lab***, where I explored the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to control surgical robotics. 🤖✨

# 🔭 Current Endeavour
Currently, I'm diving deeper into the world of artificial intelligence, LLMs (Large Language Models), and security, seeking ways to blend these technologies with human-computer interaction to create impactful solutions.


# 🌱 My Life
My life journey always goes out of plan, but I'm surviving it!!!
Curious about what's the next thing gonna hit me
Unexpected difficulties are opportunities for me to improve, be receptive, and be optimistic!
- **Fun fact:** When I'm not coding or buried in textbooks, you'll find me lost in the world of books 📚 and cooking 🍳.
